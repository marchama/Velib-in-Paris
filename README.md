# Velib-in-Paris

I ran this project as part of the validation of the IBM coursera class 'Data Science'. This is my very first step in Data analysis and Python programming. 

You can find the codes of the project itself in the file 'Notebook_Velib_In_Paris'. I saved some intermediate data files in the folder 'Inputs'
